Jacket, implementation of Lisp (probably in future - Racket) on JVM.
Pet project pursuing clear goals:
1. Learning JVM internals
2. Practicing theory of compilation and interpretation
3. Building yeat another lisp implementation
4. Doing something fun, big and ambitious
- in that oreder.

Current state:
1. Lexer with regular grammar described by the means of finite state machine. Battatrries (fsm) included. Ready.
2. Parser. Ready.
3. Semantic analysis. In progress, almost ready.
4. Code generation. Yet to come.
4. Optimizations. Probably.

Not really serious about optimizations and production ready release. For now. :)
