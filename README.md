Jacket, implementation of Lisp (probably in future - Racket) on JVM.
Pet project pursuing clear goals:
1. Learning JVM internals
2. Practicing theory of compilation and interpretation
3. Building yeat another lisp implementation
4. Doing something fun, big and ambitious
- in that oreder.

Not really serious about optimizations and production ready release. For now. :)
